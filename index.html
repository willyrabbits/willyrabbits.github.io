            <p>Welcome to my <span class="bold">'unconventional'</span> resume. If you have arrived here, let me
                explain something to
                you about who I am beyond a developer.</p>
            <p>The first thing that you need to know about me is that I love to create stuff. I love to start new
                challenges and I am one of those people who think that if you want something you have to go for it, that
                impossible is nothing. And I take this mantra with me everywhere.</p>
            <p>Some examples of that are: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>When I wanted a surfboard, but I think that price in the store was too
                    high. I just bought the materials and tried to make it myself. I had a lot of hope in that project,
                    but not having the proper tools at home made it impossible to complete. I mess it up and all my hope
                    turned into frustration, but you always learn from your experiences! It made me analyze what I did
                    wrong and I will not make the same mistakes in the future :)</li>
                <img alt="me creating a surfboard" src="assets/surfboard.jpeg" />
                <li>Another personal project I developed (this time successfully), is creating what I call a ski-bike.
                    At one point I found myself with a broken bike and a pair of useless skis. I designed a plan, I got
                    all the tools and I materialized my thoughts. I learned quite a bit from this project as well.</li>
                <img alt="the skibike that I made" src="assets/skibike.jpeg" />
                <li>What's next? I am planning about building my own skateboard, I want to replicate an actual surfboard
                    but with wheels, I only need to find the proper timber.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As you may have deducted now, surfing is something I love, not only the sport but also all the vibes that
                surround it. Sadly I am not pretty good at it, so I decided to create an Instagram account where I
                uploaded all the pictures I took while my friends still in the water but I was exhausted already. Check
                my pictures <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/willygrapher/">here</a> :)</p>

            <p>Talking about my <span class="bold">hobbies</span>, I like sports in general, but running, biking,
                skiing, and surfing are what I
                like the most. I have even made a couple of short-distance triathlons, which make me pretty proud.
                <br />
                Another thing I like to do in my free time (apart from Netflix what everyone enjoys) I playing
                Playstation with my friends.
                <br />
                Traveling is part of my DNA, since I discovered it I can not stop doing it. I have visited plenty of
                different counties and cultures, which make me value things in another way. Right now, Africa is the
                only continent that I have not visited yet. I have been living in Australia for more than a year (I have
                plenty of fun stories to tell you about it) and in Canada for almost a year (I spent the first wave of
                the pandemic there). Both these trips have been life-changing but the travel that has impacted me the
                most was the time when I went to Moscow on my own.
