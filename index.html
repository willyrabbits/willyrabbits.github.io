                <p>Welcome to my <span class="bold">'unconventional'</span> resume. If you have arrived here, let me
                    explain something to
                    you about who I am beyond a developer. That is a <span class="italic">Work In Progress</span>
                    project, so please don't be very
                    critical with me :)</p>

            <!--PERSONAL PROJECTS-->
            <div>
                <h4 class="section-header">Personal projects</h4>
                <p>The first thing that you need to know about me is that I love to create stuff. I love to start new
                    challenges and I am one of those people who think that if you want something you have to go for it,
                    that
                    impossible is nothing. And I take this mantra with me everywhere.</p>
                <p>Some examples of that are: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When I wanted a surfboard, but I was thinking that price in the store was too
                        high. I just bought the materials and tried to make it myself. I had a lot of hope in that
                        project,
                        but not having the proper tools at home made it impossible to complete. I mess it up and all my
                        hope
                        turned into frustration, but you always learn from your experiences! It made me analyze what I
                        did
                        wrong and I will not make the same mistakes in the future :)</li>
                    <img alt="me creating a surfboard" src="assets/projects-pics/surfboard.jpeg" />
                    <li>Another personal project I developed (this time successfully), was creating what I call a
                        ski-bike.
                        At one point I found myself with a broken bike and a pair of useless skis. I designed a plan, I
                        got
                        all the tools and I materialized my thoughts. I learned quite a bit from this project as well.
                    </li>
                    <img alt="the skibike that I made" src="assets/projects-pics/skibike.jpeg" />
                    <li>What's next? I am planning about building my own skateboard, I want to replicate an actual
                        surfboard
                        but with wheels, I only need to find the proper piece of timber.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As you may have deducted now, surfing is something I love, not only the sport but also all the vibes
                    that
                    surround it. Sadly I am not pretty good at it, so I decided to create an Instagram account where I
                    uploaded all the pictures I took while my friends still in the water but I was exhausted already.
                    Check
                    my pictures <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/willygrapher/">here</a> :)</p>

            <!--HOBBIES-->
            <div>
                <h4 class="section-header">Hobbies</h4>
                <p>Talking about my hobbies, I like sports in general, but running, biking,
                    longboarding, skiing, and surfing are what I like the most. I have even made a couple of
                    short-distance
                    triathlons, I have skied in the Rockie Mountains in Canada, and I have been able of surfing in one
                    of the most
                    famous spots in the world (Snapper Rocks). All this make me very very proud.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another thing I like to do in my free time (apart from Netflix what everyone enjoys), is playing
                    Playstation with my friends. I am more a Call of Duty guy, but I will be happy to challange you into
                    a FIFA match whenever.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Traveling is part of my DNA, since I discovered it I can not stop doing it. I have visited plenty of
                    different counties and cultures, which make me value things in another way. Right now, Africa is the
                    only continent that I have not visited yet. I have been living in Australia for more than a year (I
                    have plenty of fun stories to tell you about it) and in Canada for almost a year (I spent the first
                    wave
                    of the pandemic there). Both these trips have been life-changing but the travel that has impacted me
                    the most was the time when I went to Moscow on my own.
                </p>

            <!--TRAVELS-->
            <div>
                <h4 class="section-header">Travels</h4>
                <p>Since I got my first income, I started traveling (as well as getting my Spotify subscription, yep! I
                    love music as well). I have been traveling quite a lot around Spain, and visiting a few countries
                    all over Europe as well. Some of the countries I have visited are: Portugal, Andorra, France, UK,
                    Switzerland, Italy, Malta, Germany, Hungary (I even attended to Sziget festival there, what a nice
                    experience), Netherlands, and Russia.</p>
                <p>As I never studied abroad and I always thought that languages are such an important tool. I decided
                    to save the money and go to <span class="bold">Australia</span> to learn English and have a
                    life-time experience (luckily, the
                    company I was working for at the moment offered me to keep working together, 100% remotely).</p>
                <p>I first arrived to Australia (Feb 2017) and spent the very first week <a target="_blank"
                        href="https://www.couchsurfing.com/">Couchsurfing</a>. I still being infinite thankful to that
                    person that helped me then.</p>
                <p>I was down under for less than 3 months when (doing stupid things) I broke my ankle. The doctors put
                    my leg on a cast, and it was not until 2 weeks later that they told me that I needed surgery. That
                    moment is when I decided to go back home (temporarily). I had surgery in Spain, had a little bit of
                    rehab, and as soon as I could I went back to Aus, I had visa for more than a year then and I was not
                    going to renounce to it.</p>
                <p>Breaking my leg so far from home made me change from a kid into a man. Going to the hospital in a
                    foreign language, crossing the world (literally) on crutches, having the courage to return to
                    Australia when I could barely stand on my feet, ... All that thing made me be the man I am right
                    now.</p>
                <p>Running is something I have always liked, and not being able to do it was horrible to me (maybe if I
                    were able I would choose to stay on the sofa, but not even having the chance is what was annoying
                    me). Then I saw a couple of documentaries on TV talking about the relation o nutrition and injures
                    recovering. So that made me think, I changed my diet and (I don't know if it really worked, or if it
                    was my desire for getting better) after some weeks I was running again. You may be indifferent about
                    that, but what I want to say is that when I really want something, I go for it and get it, no matter
                    what.</p>
                <p>Some more remarkable experiences I had down there are: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>On the first date with who now is my girlfriend, we (despite we both don't like much planes)
                        decided to do Skydiving in Cairns.</li>
                    <li>I drove a jeep through the beach in Fraser Island. </li>
                    <li>Around one year after my surgery, I ran the Sydney Half Marathon, getting really close to my
                        personal record on that distance.</li>
                    <li>I spent my last month in the country on a rented van, traveling all around. Among all the places
                        that I visited, I went to Uluru (such a beautiful and mystic place), after 2/3 days of driving
                        across the desert.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To finish my amazing trip to the other side of the world, I spent 1 month traveling about Indonesia,
                    getting to know the culture and learning from their non-stressed pace of life.</p>
                <p>After a long time living the Australian lifestyle I felt like Barcelona was not the place for me,
                    things in the company I was working were not going well, and the opportunity to go to <span
                        class="bold">Canada</span>
                    appeared. So I decide to take that opportunity and bring my English to the next level (as well as
                    living another life-time experience).</p>
                <p><span class="bold">CANADA</span> WORK IN PROGRESS...</p>
                <p>All the trips I have made were awesome, and I would not change a single detail of them but after
                    (around) 3 years traveling, I am looking forward to settle down and have a little bit more
                    stability.</p>
                <div id="trips-pictures"></div>
                <p>More trips are about, to come. Please stay tuned.</p>
            </div>
            <!--LANGUAGES-->
            <div>
                <h4 class="section-header">Languages</h4>
                <p>As I have said, knowing different languages gives you one of the most powerful skills: the
                    ability to
                    communicate.</p>
                <p>Here are the languages I am able to say more than two words in a row.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span class="bold">Spanish & Catalan</span>: I was born in Barcelona and I have been
                        spending my
                        first +20years of my life here, so I have both of them as my mother tongue.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="bold">English</span>: I have been studying English for so long that I can not
                        even
                        remember when I started doing it. Plus, my +2 years living in Australia + Canada gave me the
                        confidence to handle any conversation with anyone in that language :)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="bold">Franch & German</span>: I studied French for 2 years at primary school,
                        and
                        its similarity with Catalan made me able to catch it. But only two years of school for
                        learning
                        a language is pretty far from mastering it... I have still work to do here. About German, I
                        studied an introductory course for a year during my university years, it is the language I
                        understand and can speak less (of all listed above) but I know enough for moving around
                        Berlin
                        understanding the signs and even order at restaurants. At least I am not afraid of the
                        language
                        anymore (you have to admit that when you don't have a clue of German it can sound
                        frightening).
                    </li>

                <h4 class="section-header">Me as a coworker</h4>
                <p>You may be wondering... What can you expect from me when we work together?</p>
                <p>I believe that a good atmosphere in the workplace is the key to achieve success and to be motivated.
                    That is why I always try to be in a good mood and give the best out of myself in order to draw a
                    smile on my colleges' faces. .</p>
                <p>I am a curious, cheerful, responsible, and disciplined person. I have experience working in both,
                    teams and solo. Actually, I count with quite a bit of remote working experience.</p>
